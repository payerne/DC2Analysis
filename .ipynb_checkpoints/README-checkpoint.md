# DC2Analysis
My first GitHub repository for the DC2 galaxy catalog analysis.

In the GitRepository, we develop statistical analysis for the weak-lensing galaxy cluster mass determination in DC2 catalogs developed by DESC (Dark Energy Science Collaboration). The backend that is used for modelling cluster lensing properties is the clmm (Cluster Lensing Mass Modelling) library available in the Git Repository at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CLMM.
